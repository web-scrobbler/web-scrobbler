# Contributing

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Web Scrobbler!

If you want to contribute to a `metadata-filter` module, which is used to
filter track info in this extension, follow [this link][MfRepository].

If you find an issue on the extension website, please, submit it
to a [relevant repository][WebsiteRepository].

## Translating the extension

Follow this [wiki page][TranslateHowto] for details.

## Submitting issues

-   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under issues.
-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open
a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant
information as possible.

Please read [this page][DebugExtension] to understand how to get
the extension logs. If you don't know how to report bugs effectively,
please use [this article][ReportBugs] as a guideline.

### Submitting rules

Please make sure your issue describes only one feature, request or bug.

## Submitting pull requests

-   Read [our wiki][Wiki].
-   Fork the Web Scrobbler [git repository][Repository].
-   Create a pull request against the [**master**][RepositoryMaster] branch.
-   Ensure the PR description **clearly** describes the problem and solution.
Include the relevant issue number(s) if applicable.
-   Ensure CI tests pass.

It's also worth reading [how to write][CommitMessages] good commit messages.

### Submitting rules

Please open a separate PR for each *logical* addition, change, or deletion.
For example, if you added a new connector, and fixed an existing one, open
two separate PRs for each change; if you added a new feature and updated
connectors to use this feature, you can open a single PR containing all changes.

If you plan on contributing something that requires significant changes, please
contact us first. You can find us in [Discord][Discord-Server]; alternatively,
feel free to open a new issue or discussion and tell us about your plans.

### Setup environment

Follow [this][SetupDevEnv] wiki page for details.

### Connectors development

Connectors development is explained in [this][ConnectorsDev].

### Coding conventions

We use a number of linters to verify the source code. Please ensure before
committing the changes they meet our requirements by running `grunt lint`.
If you're not familiar with Grunt, please read [this article][Grunt].

We also use EditorConfig, which helps to keep code in the same code style
in different code editors and IDE's. If you haven't used EditorConfig before,
you can visit [EditorConfig website][EditorConfig] for further information.
