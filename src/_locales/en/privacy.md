# Privacy policy

This privacy policy explains what data we collect and store; how we use and disclose this data.

**Important note**: This document is applicable to Web Scrobbler v2.40.0 and newer.

## What data is collected?

The extension does not collect any of your personal data.

## What data is stored by the extension?

Your settings and credentials are stored within your browser. The extension stores:

 - Your credentials of scrobble services
 - Your personal Web Scrobbler settings
 - Your edited tracks
 - Your custom URL patterns for connectors
 - System information of the extension

Your credentials are used to communicate with scrobble services only.

All data is used by the extension internally; we don't send this data to 3rd-party services.

## Why does the extension access to all websites?

The extension supports several self-hosted services (e.g. Funkwhale), which are supposed to have user-defined URLs. The extension could not know these URLs, that's why access to all websites is required.

Also, it asks accessing for user convenience only. Users will not be prompted to confirm access to new websites added in new extension versions.
