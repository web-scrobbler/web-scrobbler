## What data is stored by the extension?

Your settings and credentials are stored within your browser. The extension stores:

 - System information of the extension

Your credentials are used to communicate with scrobble services only.

All data is used by the extension internally; we don't send this data to 3rd-party services.

## Why does the extension access to all websites?

The extension supports several self-hosted services (e.g. Funkwhale), which supposed to have user-defined URLs. The extension could not know these URLs, that's why the accessing to all websites is required.

Also, it asks accessing for user convenience only. Users will not be prompted to confirm access to new websites added in new extension versions.
